### What is a VPC?
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. VPC customers can run code, store data, host websites, and do anything else they could do in an ordinary private cloud, but the private cloud is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider.
### What is CIDR block?
Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) is a set of Internet protocol standards that is used to create unique identifiers for networks and individual devices. The IP addresses allow particular information packets to be sent to specific computers.
### What is an internet gateway?
A computer that sits between different networks or applications. The gateway converts information, data or other communications from one protocol or format to another. A router may perform some of the functions of a gateway. An Internet gateway can transfer communications between an enterprise network and the Internet.
### What is a route table? 
A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed. In other words, a route table tells the network packets which way they need to go to get to their desitination.
### What is subnet?
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, into a specific subnet. When you create a subnet, you specify the IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet, which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block.
### What is NACL?
An optional layer of security that acts as a firewall for controlloing traffic in and out of a subnet. Multiple subnets can be assosiated with a single network ACL, but a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time.
